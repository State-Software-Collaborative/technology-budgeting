# Limit total spending

The greater the amount of money spent on a software project, the greater the odds of failure. As a general rule, plan to spend no more than \$10 million on an entire project.<sup id="reference-10"><a href="#footnote-10">10</a></sup> (There are rare exceptions for extraordinarily complex systems like unemployment insurance, Medicaid Eligibility &amp; Enrollment, and Medicaid Management Information Systems.)

## Checklist

- [ ] The requesting agency understands they’re not being given a small percentage of the resources they believe they need — instead, they’re being given an entirely new process to procure software, as well as adequate funding under that model

## Key questions

- If the project "requires" \$20 million in funding, what value can be delivered to end users with \$10 million? Or \$2 million? (If the answer is "none," then this is a project doomed to fail)
- When this spending is matched by federal dollars — especially at a highly-leveraged rate, like the 9:1 match provided by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services for Medicaid Management Information Systems — is anybody going to get in trouble for leaving money on the table?
- Is there somebody whose performance is measured by how much grant funding they raise and who has an incentive to demand that \$100 million be spent, instead of \$10 million?

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-10">10. In The Standish Group’s 2014 CHAOS Report, based on a survey of 25,000 software projects, they found that <a href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2014.pdf#page=3">software projects that cost more than $10 million succeed only 8% of the time</a>. Outcomes improve substantially as the dollar value is reduced, peaking at a 70% success rate for projects under $1 million. <a href="#reference-10">↩︎</a></p>
