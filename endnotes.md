<p class="footnote" id="footnote-1">1. Projects valued at $6M or greater, in Europe and the United States, that were completed satisfactorily, on time, and within budget. From The Standish Group’s "<a href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/Haze4.pdf">Haze</a>," based on their CHAOS database. <a href="#reference-1">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-2">2. Of the $90 billion in federal IT spending in FY2019, 80% is allocated for maintenance of legacy software, according to the GAO’s June 2019 report, "<a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-19-471">Agencies Need to Develop Modernization Plans for Critical Legacy Systems</a>." They write that inadequately-maintained legacy software leads to security risks, unmet mission needs, staffing issues, and increased costs. <a href="#reference-2">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-3">3. The National Association of State Budget Officers’ “2018 State Expenditure Report” finds that federal grants provide an average of 31.2% of each state’s budget, climbing by 5.7% in FY2018. <a href="#reference-3">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-4">4. A user story reads in form of "as a [role], I need [this thing], so I can [accomplish this]." For example, "as a social worker, I need case notes to be cached on my phone, so that I can access case notes in areas without mobile phone service." All technical work is done in the service of addressing a user story. <a href="#reference-4">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-5">5. Stack Overflow’s 2018 survey of 57,075 developers found that <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018#work-_-which-methodologies-do-developers-use">85% of professional software developers use agile</a>. And <a href="https://softwaretestinggenius.com/docs/4aa5-7619.pdf">a 2015 study by Hewlett Packard</a> found that "the vast majority of organizations [they] surveyed reported that today they primarily use Agile methods." The process described here is not extraordinary in any way. <a href="#reference-5">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-6">6.

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-7">7. For details, see the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General report about the Healthcare.gov failure, "<a href="https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-06-14-00350.asp">Case Study of CMS Management of the Federal Marketplace</a>" and Harvard Business School case study, "<a href="https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-spectacular-fall-and-fix-of-healthcare-gov">The Spectacular Fall and Fix of HealthCare.gov</a>." <a href="#reference-7">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-8">8. For an example RFP, see the <a href="https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq">U.S. Tax Court’s 2018 EF-CMS RFQ</a>, which includes a QASP, under the <a href="https://github.com/ustaxcourt/case-management-rfq/blob/master/02_SOW.md#deliverables-and-performance-standards">"Deliverables and Performance Standards" section</a>. <a href="#reference-8">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-9">9. For more about the difference between O&amp;M and continuous agile development, read <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/02/23/software-maintenance-is-an-anti-pattern/">"Software maintenance is an anti-pattern"</a> on the 18F blog. <a href="#reference-9">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-10">10. In The Standish Group’s 2014 CHAOS Report, based on a survey of 25,000 software projects, they found that <a href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2014.pdf#page=3">software projects that cost more than $10 million succeed only 8% of the time</a>. Outcomes improve substantially as the dollar value is reduced, peaking at a 70% success rate for projects under $1 million. <a href="#reference-10">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-11">11. In The Standish Group’s 2014 CHAOS Report, based on a survey of 25,000 software projects, they found that <a href="https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2014.pdf#page=3">software projects’ outcomes get worse as more money is spent</a>. Limiting the spending on each contract segments the project into smaller components, making each component — and the entire project — more likely to succeed. <a href="#reference-11">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-12">12. Alaska’s Department of Health &amp; Social Services faced this challenge in 2017, and their Contracts and Procurement Manager wrote about the process that they used to attract small, agile, Alaskan vendors in "<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/09/12/how-alaska-is-using-transparency/">How Alaska is using transparency to attract modern software vendors</a>." <a href="#reference-12">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-13">13. The Bureau of Labor Statistics provides <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes151132.htm#IDX701">state-level wage information for software developers</a>, which shows that the difference between the most expensive developers (Washington state) and the least expensive (Puerto Rico) is a 150% wage gap. Even within states there can be tremendous variation in labor costs between urban areas and rural areas. As a result, insisting that vendor teams work on-site can double the cost of software. <a href="#reference-13">↩︎</a></p>

<p class="footnote" id="footnote-14">14. See "<a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/">18F’s best practices for making distributed teams work</a>" for specifics. <a href="#reference-14">↩︎</a></p>
